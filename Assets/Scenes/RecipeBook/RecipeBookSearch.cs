                 * by default in whitelist mode the default junction between items is considered logical AND
                 * Therefore, every ingredient listed needs to show up
                 * LOGICAL AND DELIMITORS:
                 * ' ', ',', ';', ':', '/n', '&', '.' and tab (forgot the character code. Using whitespace filtering and the others noted)
                 * The following delimiters can be considered logical OR instead: 
                 * '|'
                 * Finally, the prefix of '!' will function as a logical NOT
                 * In addition the delimitors of (/), [/], and {/} can be used to create recursive calls
                 * In the event of a partial or misaligned set of groupings, they will be dropped, and undefined filtering may occur
                 * Due to the whitelist/blacklist, this results in a DeMorgan's behavior,
                 * blacklists will exclude any entries that include any default ANDS
                 * blacklists will require BOTH ORS to be present to exclude
                 * and finally blacklists will try to include sections prefixed by NOTS
                 * This may cause odd results as the WHOLE expression is inverted by the whitelist setting AFTER whitelist style handling
                 * This is all technically undocumented code, but its functionality a good filtering system SHOULD include
                 * Likewise, be aware that advanced sorting is done individually per category,
                 * so the ingredient check, tool check, and name check are all independant
                 * I'll try to update the necessary code for this filtering logic when I can,
                 * but it's one of those things that I don't know how much time I can devote to it...
                 * It is a project for Academia, and this is an outline of how I believe it should be done
                 * How I'm actually able to implement it is a different story,
                 * especially considering: 1. This project is closed source as I write this
                 * 2. I am heavily time constricted
                 * 3. Pressure is to deliver a "working" version, not make each feature ideal
